# COMP0043 Code

This notebook contains python code I wrote for many of the problems found in UCL's COMP0043 Numerical Methods course.

May contain bugs. May be verbose.

If you are also taking this course and the syllabus is the same as in 2022, I suggest learning how these processes work and being able to produce similar programs from memory.

The notebook includes:
 - LCG
 - Fibonacci Generator
 - Standard Normal Inversion
 - Exponential Inversion
 - Acceptance Rejection Method (Standard Normal)
 - Acceptance Rejection Method (Exponential)
 - Box-Muller
 - Variant of Marsaglia
 - Correlated Normal Variable Generation
 - Van Der Corput
 - Halton Sequence *(pointer to someone else's code)
 - Arithmetic Brownian Motion
 - Geometric Brownian Motion
 - Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process
 - CIR Feller Condition
 - Constant Elasticity of Variance Model
 - Brownian Bridge
 - Heston Stochastic Volatility Model
 - Poisson Jump Diffusion Process
 - Poisson Normal Jump Diffusion Process
 - Gamma Process
 - Merton Jump Diffusion Process
 - Kou Diffusion Process
 - Time Changed Brownian Motion. (The Variance Gamma Process)
 - Analytical Options Pricing where Underlying Follows GBM
 - Plot of Options Pricing
